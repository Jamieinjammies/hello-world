# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow.
I am a 47 year old mother of 2 children with disabilities. Dispite having two advanced degrees, I have found myself in a position of being unable to maintain a job that requires a traditional working environment due to my son's health. I would ideally like to move toward utilizing my MBA in a capacity that allows me to do data analysis from my home. That is what has brought me to this program.
